At 2:10 PM, we listened to a short briefing by Dr. Haswadi bin Hasan, and by 2:25 PM, we arrived at UTM Digital. Next, we then attended a 1.5-hour talk at the Dewan Seminar, moderated by **Mohd Farid bin Sarji**, 

Four speakers covered UTM Digital services, WiFi, wired networks, and data engineering. The session began with an introduction to UTM Digital’s vision, mission, and core functions, followed by Aslinda binti Mohamad Aris explaining key UTM services. She highlighted UTMID for accessing WiFi and portals and emphasized the importance of checking the official UTM email for updates. She also discussed the Digital Care Unit, which assists with UTMID and software-related issues but does not support personal devices.

Next, Ts. Khairul Nitzam bin Mohamad Razali and Mohm Hamri bin Yusuf spoke about UTM’s WiFi network, which has a total bandwidth of 30 Gbps, capable of speeds up to 270 Mbps. They highlighted proactive actions taken in October, which included issuing 62 tickets to resolve network issues, most of which were caused by power loss during rainy days.

The discussion then shifted to UTM’s wired network, noting upgrades to 1 Gbps speeds in faculty labs by the end of 2023 and describing the network structure in the **FC block**, which supports efficient data transfer across campus.

Finally, Mohamad Hafiz bin Mohamad Nazir explained UTM’s data architecture, focusing on the main servers, **Oracle RAC 19C** and **MySQL**, which are supported by a data warehouse for predictive analysis. This data is then submitted to external systems like **MYRA**, **SETARA**, **MYMOHES**, and **KPT**, ensuring UTM's digital infrastructure supports both academic and administrative functions effectively.

The talk provided a comprehensive and insightful overview of UTM's digital services and infrastructure. It highlighted key services like **UTMID** for accessing WiFi and portals, the robust **WiFi** and **wired networks** supporting fast speeds across campus, and the advanced **data architecture** driving predictive analysis. The proactive actions taken to resolve network issues and the focus on continuous upgrades demonstrated UTM's commitment to improving digital services. Overall, the session was informative, showcasing how UTM’s digital infrastructure enhances both academic and administrative functions.

The talk concluded at **4:00 PM**, and by **4:10 PM**, we proceeded to visit the **open office on Level 2**. Inside, we explored various departments, including **Research** and **Academic**. The open office was well-equipped with facilities such as an **entertainment room** for relaxation and a **meeting room** for discussions and collaborations, providing a productive and comfortable working environment.  

At **4:30 PM**, we visited the **Digital Unit on the ground floor**, where the person in charge gave an overview of **UTM Digital Care**. This unit supports essential digital services and includes facilities such as a **multipurpose room** for flexible activities, a **technician room** for technical support and maintenance, and a **Sangfor room** for managing network security systems.
