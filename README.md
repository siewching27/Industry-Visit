On 10th December 2024 (Tuesday), we had an industry visit to UTM Digital (UTMD), gathering at N24 at 2 PM with around 150 participants, led by Dr. Haswadi bin Hasan.

At 2:10 PM, we listened to a short briefing by Dr. Haswadi bin Hasan, and by 2:25 PM, we arrived at UTM Digital. Next, we then attended a 1.5-hour talk at the Dewan Seminar, moderated by **Mohd Farid bin Sarji**, 
The session featured four speakers who discussed UTM Digital services, WiFi, wired networks, and data engineering.

The talk concluded at **4:00 PM**, and by **4:10 PM**, we proceeded to visit the **open office on Level 2**. Inside, we explored various departments, including **Research** and **Academic**. The open office was well-equipped with facilities such as an **entertainment room** for relaxation and a **meeting room** for discussions and collaborations, providing a productive and comfortable working environment.  

At **4:30 PM**, we visited the **Digital Unit on the ground floor**, where the person in charge gave an overview of **UTM Digital Care**. This unit supports essential digital services and includes facilities such as a **multipurpose room** for flexible activities, a **technician room** for technical support and maintenance, and a **Sangfor room** for managing network security systems.

The visit to UTM Digital was highly informative and provided valuable insights. I gained a better understanding of UTM Digitalâ€™s background, led by Nik Kamal Izuddin Nik Ibrahim, the Director of UTM Digital. I also learned about systems like UTM Smart, its data architecture, and the facilities in the open office and Digital Unit, which support academic and administrative efficiency. However, the experience could be improved by simplifying some of the technical explanations. I also hope to explore more departments within UTM Digital, such as its Data Center, in future visits.
