<h3>üí°Reflection</h3>

The visit to UTM Digital was highly informative and provided valuable insights. I gained a better understanding of UTM Digital‚Äôs background, led by Nik Kamal Izuddin Nik Ibrahim, the Director of UTM Digital. The visit to UTM Digital was highly informative and provided valuable insights into its operations and services. I gained a better understanding of UTM Digital‚Äôs background, led by **Nik Kamal Izuddin Nik Ibrahim**, the Director of UTM Digital. I learned about services like **UTMID** for accessing WiFi and portals, as well as the importance of using UTM emails. I also discovered that UTM‚Äôs **WiFi and wired networks** were upgraded at the end of 2023 to enhance connectivity and efficiency. 

Additionally, I learned that UTM uses **Oracle RAC 19C** as its database server to securely collect and manage data. The visit also highlighted the facilities in the **open office** and **Digital Unit**, which play a vital role in supporting academic and administrative efficiency.However, the experience could be improved by simplifying some of the technical explanations. I also hope to explore more departments within UTM Digital, such as its Data Center, in future visits.
